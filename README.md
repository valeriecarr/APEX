**APEX: Python Training for Faculty**  
Created by: Valerie Carr and Jaime Zuspann, San Jose State University

The aim of the Applied Programming Experiences (APEX) program is to provide lower-division students with programming experiences embedded into existing courses. Specifically, we are targeting introductory statistics and biology courses and are building curricular and co-curricular content for each discipline. APEX curricular materials will involve interactive exercises in the Python programming language.

We realize that faculty interested in adopting APEX materials may not themselves be familiar with Python, to which end we created a series of Python Training modules for faculty. These materials include an introduction to Google Colab (a free Python programming environment), Python basics, how to work with your own data, basic statistics, and basic data visualization. These materials are designed to be entirely self-paced and involve working through a series of interactive tutorials. We have also included module solutions so that you can check your work. All materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Please note that we chose to incorporate only those aspects of Python that are most relevant to the APEX materials you'll be adopting in your stats and bio courses. As such, these training materials are not as comprehensive as you would find in an introductory Python course. There are numerous free, online Python courses available if you wish to dig deeper into the language.

Links to each module can be found below, as well as in the list of files above. Please note that links to each module's solutions are only found in the list of files above.
